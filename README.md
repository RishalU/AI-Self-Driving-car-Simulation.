ðŸš— Smart Lane-Dodging AI Simulator An interactive, AI-powered driving simulation where a self-driving car intelligently navigates through dynamic traffic on a multi-lane highway. The car uses sensor-based perception and a trained neural network to predict and dodge oncoming vehicles in real-time, mimicking real-world lane-switching behavior.
